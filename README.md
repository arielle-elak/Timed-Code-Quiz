Thank you for having a look at my timed quiz!

This is a timed quiz which utilizes vanilla Javascript and local storage to keep track of highscores.

Highscores are kept in a local storage array, and organized by highest to lowest score each time you submit a new entry, or press the View Highscores button.

Each incorrect answer detracts 10 seconds from the remaining time.
Each correct answer adds 10 seconds to the remaining time.

Your remaining time is your final score!

You may then enter your initials to save your score to the list.
